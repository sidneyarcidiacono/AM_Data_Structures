# Lists and Table Structures

## Arrays & Objects "on Steroids"

### What are List & Table structures?

Lists:

 - Collections of values

 - eg. Arrays, Sets, LinkedLists

 - Great for storing values that are retrieved by postition (via index or search)

 - Also great for loops

Tables:

 - Collections of key-value pairs

 - eg. Objects, Maps

 - Great for storing values that are retrieved by key

 - Not primarily focused on loops


### Stacks

- Kind of a simplified array

Adding items: always "pushed" on top of a stack (if we use an array it's put at the end of the array).

Removing items: always "popped" from the top of the stack (LIFO)
